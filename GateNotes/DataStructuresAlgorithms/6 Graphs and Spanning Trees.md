#### 1. Types of Graphs
- Directed graph
- Undirected graph
- Null graph - graph with no edges
- Trivial graph - graph with one node
- Simple graph
	- An edge connects two different vertices
	- No two edges connect the same pair of vertices
- Multi graphs
	- Two edges can connect the same pair of vertices
- Acyclic/cyclic graph - Graph without/with cycle 
- Complete graph - Graph with all possible edges
- Connected graph - Graph in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes
