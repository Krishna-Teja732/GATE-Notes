### 1 What?
- Informal def: Light weight process
- A process can have multiple threads, the threads share the data, code and files
- Each thread has it's own **stack, register and program counter**
- Each thread is identified using a **thread id**

### 2 Why use threads?
- Process creation and process context switching is expensive
- Context switch is thread is faster
	- Is context switch between two threads of two different processes also fast
		- #TODO-Extras 
- Types: 
	- Kernel thread: 
		- Managed directly by the OS
		- The kernel thread run on the physical processor
		- Scheduled by OS
	- User thread: Part of an application
		- Each user thread will be assigned to a kernel thread to complete its computation
		- OS does not maintain these threads, 
			- These threads are not scheduled by the OS
		- Created and scheduled by the Thread library API
			- The thread library controls how the user thread is allocated a kernel thread
	- Differences: [User threads vs Kernel threads](https://www.ibm.com/docs/kk/aix/7.2?topic=processes-kernel-threads-user-threads)

#### 3 What are thread Libraries?
- Provides API for creating and managing threads
- Two implementations, thread library is in
	- User space
		- Using the API will only create a user level thread (no system call is involved)
		- The code and data of the thread library is in user space
	- Kernel Space
		- Using API will make a system call to kernel
		- The data and code of the thread library is in the kernel space
	- Examples
		- The windows thread API is a kernel level API
		- The Java Thread library uses a JVM that is platform dependent.
			- If the platform is windows, JVM uses Windows Thread API
			- If the platform is Mac, JVM uses Pthread API
