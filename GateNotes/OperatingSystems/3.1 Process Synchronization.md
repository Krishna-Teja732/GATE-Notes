#### Purpose
- Processes can coordinate with each other using shared data
- Concurrent access to shared data might lead to data inconsistency
	- Need a way to sync process and keep data consistent
- Race condition:
	- Result of a code snippet depends on the order of execution of the statements
	- Happens when two process simultaneously modify a shared variable

#### Requirements for the sync method
- Critical section
	- Portion of code that updates shared data
- Mutual Exclusion
	- Only one process can execute the critical section at any given point in time
- Bounded waiting
	- process should get access to critical section without waiting indefinitely

#### Solutions example

##### 1. Peterson Solution
- Involves 2 processes
- Two variables
	- Boolean flag\[2]: flag\[i] represents is Process P<sub>i</sub> is ready to execute critical section
	- int turn: Represents which process is execution the critical section
```
# Program for process Pi 
while (true) {
	flag[i] = true;
	turn = j;
	while (flag[j] && turn == j);

	/* critical section */

	flag[i] = false;

	/*remainder section */
}
```
- In the code above for process P<sub>i</sub>
	- P<sub>i</sub> sets the flag\[i] to true, indicating that it is ready to execute the critical section
	- In the next line, the turn is set to j
		- Which means Process j (P<sub>j</sub>) is allowed to execute first
		- If flag\[j] is true and turn is j, P<sub>j</sub> completes execution and sets  flag\[j] to false
	- Once P<sub>j</sub> finishes, P<sub>i</sub> starts execution of critical section
- **Issue**
	- What happens if two process assign the turn variable at once
	- Even if the turn variable is assigned by two process at the same time, only one of the values will be present in the turn variable 
	- that process in the turn var will continue the execution
- **Drawback**
	- Might not work in modern computers as the compilers can reorder the read and write statements
	- This is a software based solution as no support for the OS and hardware support is required

#### Hardware support for synchronization

##### 1. Memory barrier
- **What is it?**
	- This is an low level instruction 
	- used by kernel developers to write code that ensures mutual exclusion
- **What is it used for?**
	- To make a memory modification done by one processor visible to all other processors
- **What happens when this instruction is used?**
	- When the memory barrier instruction is encountered 
		- All the load and store instructions that are before the memory barrier is performed 
		- Example: This memory barrier will ensure that flag is loaded before x
	```
	while (!flag)
		memory barrier();
	print x;
	```

##### 2. Hardware instructions
- **What is it?**
	- These are instruction that are atomic(i.e. uninterruptable)
- **What does it do?**
	- These instruction performs either of the following atomically
		- either swap two words (compare and swap)
		- set a word based on a condition  (test and set)
- **What is compare and swap?**
	- An atomic instruction that cannot be interrupted
	- Example: [CMPXCHG](./References)<sup>1</sup> command in intel x86
	- What does it do?
		- We can use this instruction to acquire a lock
			- Example: Thread can enter the critical section only when `int lock = 0`
			- The thread will call the function and check if it return 0 
				- `while(compare_and_swap(&lock, 0, 1)==1);`
			- If the lock is 0, it will be set to 1, else the lock will remain 1 unless the thread that acquired the lock changes it to 0
		- The C equivalent of the compare and swap instruction
		```
		int compare_and_swap(int *value, int expected, int new value) {
			int temp = *value;
			if (*value == expected)
				*value = new value;
			return temp;
		}
		```
- **What is test and set instruction?**
	- An atomic instruction that cannot be interrupted
	- What does it do?
		- The C example of the test and set instruction
		```
		boolean test_and_set(boolean *target) {
			boolean rv = *target;
			*target = true;
			return rv;
		}
		```

##### 3. Atomic Variables
- Variables that ensure mutual exclusion
- Example: [java Atomic data types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/atomicvars.html) that ensures mutual exclusion
- This might not prevent race condition
	- Example producer consumer problem
	- 1 Produces sets the count to 1, but both consumers read the value of count as 1.
	- Problem: only one consumer should be allowed


#### High level tools for solving critical section problem

##### 1. Mutex
- What?
	- Boolean var to indicate lock
	- Also called as **Spin lock**
- How to acquire/release lock?
	- acquire()
		- atomic function to acquire lock
	- release()
		- atomic function to release lock
- Disadvantage
	- When a thread cannot acquire the lock, busy wait occurs

##### 2. Semaphores
- What
	- Int variable to represent lock
- How to acquire/release lock
	- wait()
		- **Alternate representation: P**
		- decrement int variable if it is less than 0
	- signal()
		- **Alternate representation: V**
		- increment int variable
- Usage
	- **Counting semaphore**
		- Range of int lock is unbounded 
		- Initial value of lock = number of finite resources
		- When the lock value is 0, all the resources are being used
		- When process requires lock, but if its value is 0, then process will wait for lock value to be greater than 0
	- **Binary Semaphore**
		- lock value can be 0 or 1 
		- Similar to mutex, instead of boolean binary semaphores use 0 or 1 value
- Resolving busy wait problem
	- When process is not able to acquire lock, 
		- instead of using a empty while loop, suspend the process and moving it to waiting state
		- When lock is released, wake up the process in waiting queue and move it to ready queue 


NOTE: 
- Problem with semaphore and mutex:
	- When the programmer forgets to use wait and/or signal or when they interchange the wait and signal function calls, two processes can enter the critical section
##### 3. Monitors
TODO: Learn about monitors

#### Types of locks
- **Reentrant locks**
	- A thread **can** acquire the same lock consecutively
- **Non-reentrant locks**
	- A thread **cannot** acquire the same lock consecutively
	- Example: 
		- Let's consider there is one thread and one Non-reentrant Lock
		- Once the thread has aquired and released the lock, 
		- the same thread cannot get the lock unless
			- Another Thread has acquired and released the lock

### Other issues in priority scheduling

##### Priority inversion
- Problem
	- Lets say there are three processes p1, p2, p3 in decreasing order of priority
	- p1 and p3 requires the same resource
	- When p3 is executing, p2 arrives and stops p3
	- p3 hold the resource that p1 needs
	- When p1 arrives, it cannot execute because p3 has the resource it needs
- To resolve this issue we can use **priority inheritance**
	- Both process and resources have a priority
	- The priority of a resource is the sum of priority of processes that are requesting that resource
	- The priority of the process holding that process will be incremented by the priority of the resource
