#### 1 Intro
- CPU can only access main mem and registers directly
- A process needs to be in main memory for processor to fetch it's instructions
- In the main memory, each process must have separate address space
	- To prevent a process accessing an address from a different address space 
		- Use a base and a limit register
		- The address accessed by a process must be 
			- less than or equal to base + limit and
			- greater than or equal to base
	- How is the base and limit registers loaded
		- Done by operating system

#### 2 Address binding
- How is the address determined when process code is moved from disk to main mem
	- Compile time
		- Compiler knows the initial address of main mem where program will be stored
	- Load time
		- The compiler uses relative addressing 
			- i locations after start of program
		- The final address is determined during load time
	- Execution 
		- Process can be moved between memory segments
		- Hardware support is required
		- Compiler will generate logical addresses, 
			- CPU will generate logical addresses
			- The main memory or physical memory uses physical addresses

#### 3 Logical and physical address space
- The processor generates a logical address
- This address is converted to physical address by the Memory management unit (MMU)
- Converting logical address to physical address
	- The MMU has a relocation register (instead of the base register)
		- The limit register still holds the max index from base address
	- Physical address =  logical address + \[relocation register]

#### 4 Dynamic loading
- All the code of the process in not loaded into the main memory
	- A routine is loaded only when it is called
	- The rest of the code is stored in disk in relocatable format

#### 5 Dynamic linking libraries (DLL)
- User programs can use system libraries
	- In static linking, these system libraries are also converted into machine code
	- Let say there are two programs in C, both should include a copy of the C library
- In dynamic linking
	- The system libraries are not converted into machine code during compile time

#### 6 Physical Memory allocation (contiguous memory)
- A portion of memory is allocated to a process
	- The process will be allocated to a set of contiguous physical memory locations
- The portion of memory that is free is called hole
- Which portion is allocated is based on the free space and algo used
	- Best fit
		- The smallest hole that can fit the process will be allocated
	- First fit
		- First hole that will fit the process will be allocated 
	- Worst fit
		- The largest hole will be selected
	- Next fit
		- Second hole that will fit the process will be allocated
- External fragmentation
	- Occurs Best fit and first fit 
	- fragmentation is when the memory has many small unallocated spaces
		- When combining all these spaces, another process can be loaded into main memory
	- Fragmented memory can be collated which is called compaction
		- Compaction is expensive
- Worst fit can cause internal fragmentation
	- When the allotted block is too big compared to the process needs
	- Example
		- Let the process require 2KB of memory
		- If the biggest hole(unallotted memory) is 10 KB
		- The 8 KB is not required by the process, but is still allocated
- Drawback of contiguous allocation
	- causes external fragmentation
	- instead allocate memory for a process in non contiguous manner([[4.2 Paging]])
