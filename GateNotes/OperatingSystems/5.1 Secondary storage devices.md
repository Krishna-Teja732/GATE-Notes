#### 1 Hard disk drives(HDD)
- Internal structure: ![](./Attachments/Images/hdd_internal_Structure.png)
- Platter
	- Disk that rotates
	- Each platter can use one surface or both surfaces
- Track
	- Each platter is made of multiple concentric tracks
- Sector
	- Each track is divided into multiple sectors
	- Sector is the smallest unit if transfer
	- Contains 
		- Synchronization part
			- Consists of alternating 1 and 0
			- this helps the read write head about  
				- Length of a bit
				- speed of the read write head
		- Address
			- stores the sector and track info
		- 4 KB data
			- User data
		- ECC
			- Error check bits
- Data transfer rate
	- Affected by
		- Rotation latency
			- Time required to rotate the disk such that a particular sector reached the read write head
		- Seek time
			- The time required for the read write head to move to the correct sector
- **Calculating time to transfer**
	- t<sub>avg</sub> for transferring a sector = (average rotational latency) + (average seek time) + data transfer rate
		- average rotational latency = 0.5 \* (time required for a rotation)
		- average seek time = (max seek time + min seek time)/2
		- data transfer rate = given in Bytes per second

#### 2 Non volatile memory(NVM)
- Consists of a 
	- controller
	- NAND Flash
		- Read and written in pages(similar to sectors)
		- Cannot be overwritten
			- To do so, perform erase and then write
- SSD are flash based NVM
	- Connected to PCI rather than standard bus interface

#### 3 Addressing 
- Logical address
	- This is how the processor sends the address
	- The logical blocks are one dimensional array of blocks
	- A block is the smallest unit of transfer
	- Each logical block will be mapped to a sector
- Physical address
	- The logical address is converted to the platter num, track num, sector num
	- Using this info the read write head can locate the sector and read or write its contents
- Mapping
	- Mapping of the logical block to physical block is sequential
	- First logical block can be on platter 0, track 0, sector 0
	- Second logical block will be on platter 0, track 0 and sector 1 and so on

#### 4 Disk Scheduling
- The IO requests from processes are placed in a queue
- To minimize the seek time, the requests in queue can be served based on which address is closer to the head
- Algorithms for disk scheduling
	- FCFS
		- Not efficient for HDD as it does not try to minimize the seek time
		- Used for NVM as access time is uniform
	- Shortest Seek time first 
		- Move head to the closest cylinder from the current cylinder position
	- Scan
		- Also known as elevator
		- Move head from one track to another till the end 
		- reverse the head movement and serve the requests
		- Example: ![](./Attachments/Images/disk_scan_eg.png)
	- CScan
		- Similar to scan
		- services requests only one way in the head movement
		- When head movement is reversed, no requests are served
	- CLook
		- Similar to cscan
		- Reverse the head movement at the last request
		- Example
			- Head is moving to higher cylinders
			- The request with highest cylinder is 99 (given highest cylinder is 100)
			- Reverse the head at 99
				- In scan the head goes to the last cylinder
			- Reverse the head movement and do not serve any requests
			- Do not go to the least cylinder number instead to the least request
				- In Cscan, head goes to cylinder 0, before servicing the requests
