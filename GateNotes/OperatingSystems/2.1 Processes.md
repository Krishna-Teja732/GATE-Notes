## 2. What is a process
- Program in execution

#### 2.1 Process states

- **Process States**
	a. New
	b. Running
	c. Waiting - For IO
	d. Ready - Waiting for CPU
	e. Terminated

- **How is process states represented by OS**
	- Using Process Control Block(PCB)
		- What does the PCB contain
			- Contains the info that are present in the stack frame (i.e. PC, Registers)
			- Scheduling info - priority
			- Memory management info - page tables or segment tables
			- Accounting info
			- I/O status - resources allocated, file locks

#### 2.2 CPU Scheduling 

- Create a schedule that allocates CPU to processes
	- AIM: high CPU utilization, Low starvation

- **Context Switching**
	- Stop current process exec
	- Resume exec of another process 

#### 2.3 Operations on a process

- **Process Creation**
	- **Tracking all processes**
		- Parent process creates child process
		- Parent child process are stored in the form of a tree
		- Root of process tree will be system process
	- **Resources**
		- The child process can get resources for OS or the parent process
		- When the child process is restricted to parent process resources, the resource hogging is minimized
	- **Execution**
		- Parent and child executes concurrently
		- Parent waits for child execution
	- Program data
		- Parent and child has same program and data
		- Child has a different program

- **Process Termination**
	- Using exit()
		- Occurs when process calls exit()
		- Child process can return a value to parent that is using wait()
		- All the process resources are deallocated
	- Terminate process
		- Another process terminates a process
		- The parent can terminate the child process
		- Or Parent process can be terminated, which leads to child process termination

#### 2.4. IPC

- **Why**
	- For process to communicate with each other

- **How**
	- Two methods
		- Shared memory
			- Characteristics
				- Faster
				- Process should be in the same system
			- How
				- One process creates a shared memory in its own address space
				- Another process agrees on the shared memory (OS will allow the process to access the shared space) 
				- Read or write in the shared memory
		- Message passing
			- Characteristics
				- Slower
				- Can be used in distributed systems
				- Can be direct or indirect
				- Can be synchronous or Async
			- How
				- Create mail box
				- Send and receive messages from the mail box
				- Mail box can be owned by process or the OS

#### 2.5 Amdahl's Law
- Calculate the performance gain when more cores are added 
- Formula
	- S -> % od job that is performed serially
	- N -> number of Cores

#### 2.6 Definitions
1. Task Parallelism
	1. On the same data, two different tasks are performed parallelly
	2. Example: Calculating the mean and median on a series of numbers
2. Data Parallelism
	1. The data is distributed among threads to perform single task faster
	2. Example: Similar to map reduce. Calculate the sum of all the numbers, one thread will calculate the sum of a subset of numbers
3. Multiprogramming
	1. Run multiple programs
	2. In a single core processor, when one process is waiting for IO, the CPU executes another task instead of waiting ideally
4. Multiprocessor
	1. More number of cores to execute processes parallely
