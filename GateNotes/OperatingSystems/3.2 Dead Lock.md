#### 1 What?
- Example: Consider the below resource allocation graph, This case leads to  dead lock 
	- Process P1 <- Resource R1
	- Process P2 <- Resource R2
	- Process P1 -> Resource R2
	- Process P2 -> Resource R1
- Conditions for deadlock to occur (All condition must be satisfied)
	- Circular wait
	- Hold and wait
		- process does not release resource until it completes
	- Mutual exclusion in resource
	- No preemption in resource
		- Example when performing File writes, preemption is not possible

#### 2 Live lock
- What?
	- Similar to dead lock
	- Operation by a thread fails and thread repeats operation indefinitely
		- Prevented by repeating the operation at random times (Similar to exponential backoff in ethernets)
	- Example: When P1 requires resources for P2, terminate P2 and restart P2
		- This can lead to processes being terminated repeatedly

#### 3 Handling Deadlocks
1. Ignore
2. Prevention
	1. Make any of the necessary condition for deadlock as false
	2. Drawback: Resource utilization is less
3. Avoidance
	1. Gain additional info about the resources required and allocate resources such that dead lock does not occur
	2. Example: Banker's Algo
4. Recovery
	1. Detect deadlock and recover form it
