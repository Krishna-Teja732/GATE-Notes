### Gates and Boolean expressions
- All information in computers are stored and manipulated in binary from
- The gates manipulate these binary information
	- Truth Table: represents the I/O of a gate
	- Boolean Expression: simplified from of the truth table
- Basic Gates

- The following image represents the boolean Identities
	- These can be used to simplify complex boolean expressions

#### Simplifying the boolean expression using K map
- We need gates to perform any boolean  expression 
- to use lesser gates we need to simplify the expression
- The map provides the procedure to simplify a boolean exp

##### Definitions and representation
- **Min-term**
	- A combination of variable in the truth table
	- If a boolean expression has 2 variables {A, B}, then the min terms in the truth table are AB, AB', A'B, A'B' 
- **Number of entries in the truth table/Number of min-terms in truth table**
	- If a boolean expression has n variables, then the number of entries will be 2^n if each variable can take a value of 0 or 1
- **Simplified representation of boolean expression**
	- Min-terms that give a result of 1 in the truth table can be used to represent the truth table
	- For example consider the following truth table
		![[truth_table_1.png]]
	- The min-terms the produce the result one are {001, 100, 101, 110, 111}, these are binary combination, by converting it to decimal we get {1,4,5,6,7}
	- The simplified representation of the truth table will be

##### K-Map method
- **STEP 1**: Draw a grid with 2^n squares, the row represents floor(n/2) min-terms and the column represents ceil(n/2) min-terms (A grid shaped truth table instead of a list)
	- For example if there are three variables {A,B,C}, the row will have A and column will represent the binary combinations of BC
		![[truth_table_1_k_map_represrntation.png]]
	- **Notice that the adjacent binary combination vary by one bit** i.e. for BC the combination is 00, 01, 11, 10 and **not** 00, **01, 10**, 11 
- **STEP 2**: Mark one in the squares of the min-terms that give the result 1
	- Example:
		![[truth_table_1_k_map.jpg]]
- **STEP 4**: Group the adjacent squares that are marked with 1 based on the following rules
	- Squares that are to the top, down, bottom and up are considered as adjacent squares
	- For the squares in one edge, the squares in other edge are considered as adjacent (similar to circular linked list)
	- All the four corners are considered to be adjacent
	- When grouping x number of squares, x should be an integral power of 2
	- When grouping, a square can be a part of multiple groups
	- Example: 
		![[truth_table_1_k_map_groups.jpg]]
- **STEP 5**: Write the simplified expression. The simplified expression will be the sum of boolean expression for each group
	- Example: 
		![[truth_table_1_simplified_boolean_exp.jpg]]

##### Product of sum representation
- Group 1's in K-map will give sum of products representation of boolean expression F
- Group 0's in K-map will give sum of products representation of complement of F, 
	- the complement of this result will give the product of sum representation of F


#### Don't care conditions in K-map
- What are don't care conditions
	- The result produced from some min-terms are not used. These min-terms from the don't care condition
- How to find the don't care conditions
	- Don't care conditions will be explicitly mentioned
- How does it affect K-map simplification
	- For such min-terms, fill X in the K-map
	- The X can either be 0 or 1 in order to get the simplified boolean expression
