### Representing numbers
- Binary - Integers 
	- Signed Magnitude
		- Most significant bit is the sign bit
	- 1's complement 
		- Subtract +ve signed magnitude number from (2^n - 1)
		- n -> total number of bits including sign bit
	- 2's complement
		- Subtract +ve signed magnitude number from 2^n
		- or add 1 to 1's complement
	- **Need for other representation**
		- 2's complement can be used for efficient arithmetic operations
- **Floating point numbers**
	- Representation: use scientific notation with
		- Sign for the number
		- Significant digits
		- Signed power

**Floating point number representation and operations** #TODO
