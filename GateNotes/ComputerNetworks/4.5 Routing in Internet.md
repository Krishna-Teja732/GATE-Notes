#### 1 Routing protocols used in the internet
- **Intra AS routing algorithms**
	- Used within the AS
	- Example: RIP, OSPF
- **Inter AS routing algorithm**
	- Used between AS
	- Example: BGP


#### 2 Intra AS routing protocols

##### 2.1 RIP(Routing information protocol)
- **What type of algo?**
	- Distributed routing algo similar to Distance vector routing algo 
- **What is the least cost path in this algo?**
	- The least number of hops will be the least cost path
	- This implies each link has the same cost
- **What is a hop?**
	- A hop is the number of subnets traversed between source router and the destination subnet
- **What entries does a routing table consist?**
	- The routing table record consists three fields
		- The subnet address
		- The next router address
			- This is the IP address of the next router along the shortest path 
		- The hops required to reach the subnet
	- Example: 
		- Let router A have the subnets u,v
		- There will be two records <u, -, 1> and <v, -, 1> in the forwarding table
		- If subnets w can be reached using router B with 3 hops, the forwarding table of router A will have the record
			- <w, B, 3>
- **How does router A get the subnets reachable by router B?**
	- RIP uses UDP to advertise the subnets reachable by each router
	- Each router has an application process that sends UDP packets, every 30 seconds, containing its the routing table records
- **Protocol layer**
	- RIP is implemented as an Application layer protocol even though it can modify the routing table information(which belongs to the network layer)
	- RIP uses UDP as the underlying Transport layer protocol

##### 2.2 OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- **What type of algo?**
	- Link state algorithm
- **Steps to configure routing table**
	- At each router, the map of the entire network is obtained
		- All the link state info is available through **link flooding**
	- Once the entire network is mapped. each router locally runs Dijkstra's algo to determine the shortest path from itself to all the subnets in the network
- **What is link flooding**
	- #TODO 
- **Configuring OSPF**
	- An AS using OSPF can be organised into a hierarchy, with each running its own OSPF algo


#### 3 Inter AS routing Algo
- Used between AS
- Example: BGP
##### 3.1 BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- #TODO-Extras 


#### 4 Broadcast algorithms
- Algorithms that are used to map the network
	- The network is mapped before the routing algorithm can run
- #TODO-Extras
