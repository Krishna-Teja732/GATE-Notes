#### 1 Role of Link layer
- Transports network layer packets over the links
- Receives the signals from the physical link and sends it to the network layer


##### 2 Services provided by Link layer
- **Framing**
	- Encapsulate network layer packets in frames
	- Frame format is specified by the link layer protocol
- **Link access**
	- Media access control
		- Restrict access of frame only to the destined host
		- This is used so that when hosts are connected to broadcast links, only the destined host receives the frames
- **Error detection and error correction**
- **Reliable delivery**
	- Transfer frame reliably over the link
	- Used in link that are more error prone


#### 3 Link layer implementation
- Interface between hardware link and upper OSI layers

#### 4 Error detection and error correction
