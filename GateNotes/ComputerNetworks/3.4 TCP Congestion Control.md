#### 1 What is Congestion control?
- Congestion control throttles the sender which limits the number of packets sent over the network
- **How is this different from flow control?**
	- Flow control makes sure that the sender does not overflow the receiver's receive buffer
	- Congestion control limits the rate at which packets are sent by the sender based on network congestion
- **What does network congestion mean?**
	- The network core devices cannot handle more packets due to buffers overflow
- **Approaches to congestion control**
	- End to end congestion control
		- The TCP layer determines the congestion based on packet delay and packet loss
		- When there is a packet loss, TCP assumes there is a network congestion and
			- Reduces the sender window size or
			- Doubles the RTT when a packet loss occurs
	- Network assisted congestion control
		- The intermediate network core devices provide feedback about the network congestion
		- Used in networks such as ATM


#### 2. What happens in TCP Congestion control
- **TCP uses end to end congestion control approach**
	- This is because the IP protocol, Internet's network layer protocol, does not give any feedback about the network congestion to the end hosts 
- **How to limit the send packet rate?**
	- Receiver maintains a variable: congestion window size
	- The number of unacked packets in the network(Sender window size) < min(congestion window size, receiver window size)
		- Here the receiver window size is the bytes that the receiver can accept based on the free space in the receive buffer
- **Methods to modify congestion window**
	- AIMD (additive increase multiplicative decrease)
		- Modifies the congestion window size for an on going TCP connection
		- Start at congestion window size = 1 MSS
		- Increase the congestion window size by 1 every time a +ve ack is received
		- When three duplicate ack is received
			- Set ssthresh = (sender window size)/2
			- Set sender window size to ssthresh
		- If timeout occurs, the congestion window size is set to 1
	- Slow start
		- Modifies the congestion window size at the start of the TCP connection
		- Start at congestion window size  = 1 MSS Increase
		- Double the congestion window size for every ack
			- #TODO Check if the congestion window doubles on every **RTT or every +ve ack**
		- When there is a timeout
			- Set ssthresh = (sender window size)/2 
			- Set sender window size to 1
			- Start slow start process again
		- When sender window size is equal to ssthresh, use AIMD
	- Reference question: [Find the sender window size](https://gateoverflow.in/3732/gate-it-2004-question-88)
		- Generally while solving question, the ssthresh value = (max receiver window size)/2, this value will be set even before timeouts or duplicate acks are received
