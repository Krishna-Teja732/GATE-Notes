#### 1 What is a good relational schema?
- In the logical level
	- The relations and attributes should be understandable
- In the implementation level
	- The relational schema should not cause update anomalies
		- **What are update anomalies?**
			- Consider the relation EMP_DEPT with emp_name, emp_ssn , dept_name, dept_location, dept_incharge_ssn
				- Insert anomaly
					- When inserting a new employee. the dept_name and location should be consistent with other tuples
				- Modification anomaly
					- When updating the dept_incharge_ssn all the tuples that matches should be updated
				- delete anomaly
					- If all the employee tuples of a department is deleted, then the department does not exist anymore
	- Joining two relations should not cause spurious tuples
		- **What are spurious tuples?**
			- Spurious tuples are tuples that have incorrect data
			- Example: when joining EMP and DEPT relation 
				- There should be only one tuple for each emp in result with emp info and dept info
				- If there are more than one tuples. then these tuples are spurious tuples


#### 2 Functional dependencies
- **What are functional dependencies?**
	- Let's say X and Y are two sets of attributes in relation R 
	- There is a functional dependency between X and Y, which is denoted by X -> Y
	- This implies if tuple t1\[X] = tuple t2\[X]
		- Then t1\[Y] = t2\[y]
- **What is the use of functional dependencies?**
	- Can be used to specify semantic relation between attributes
	- Tool for analyzing relational schema
	- Can be used to identify  update anomalies and spurious tuple generations
