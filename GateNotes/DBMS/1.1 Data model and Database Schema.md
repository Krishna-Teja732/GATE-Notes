##### 1 What is a data model?
- Data model describes the structure of DB
	- Used for the database engine
	- **How is the structure of the database defined?**
		- Data types
		- Constraints on Data types
		- Operations that can be performed
			- In a Relational data model, operations are denoted by [Relational Algebra](1.3%20Relational%20Algebra.md)
		- Integrity constraints
			- Specify a database state is valid or not
				- Database state?
					- The data in the database at a particular moment of time
- Categories of data model
	- Conceptual data model (High level)
		- Defines how user perceives the data
		- Example: ER model
	- Physical data model (low level)
		- Defines how the data is stored in physical devices
	- Implementation data models
		- Between physical and conceptual data model
		- Example: Relational model, Object oriented data model, hierarchical data model

##### 2 What is a schema?
- Describes the database
	- This is used by the database user to define how they store the data
		- Example: A university and an organization use relational database
			- The **capabilities of relational database** is defined by the relational data model
			- A university will have a different database schema compared to another organization's database schema
	- What is stored
		- Example student name, age etc
