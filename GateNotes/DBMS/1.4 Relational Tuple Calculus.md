#### 1 What?
- Declarative language for specifying queries
	- Declarative? indicate what you need and not how it is performed
- Tuple calculus
	- Involves tuple variable
	- Each tuple variable can take the value of a tuple from a relation 
	- General format
		- {t|CONDT(t)}
		- T is the tuple var
		- CONDT(t) is a boolean expression
		- The result will contain all the tuples that give true for CONDT(t)
	- Example
		- Get all employees for EMPLOYEE relation who's salary is more than 5000
		- {t | EMPLOYEE(t) AND t.salary > 5000}
		- {t.Fname, t.Lname | | EMPLOYEE(t) AND t.salary > 5000}


#### 2 Syntax
- {t1.Aj, t2.Ak, ..., tn.Am | COND(t1, t2, ..., tn, tn+1, tn+2, ..., tn+m)}
- The first part of the syntax is used to select the attributes form each tuple variable
- The second part of the syntax contains the boolean condition
- Formula is made of atoms. Atoms can be of the from
	- R(ti): This denotes that ti takes the values from Relation R
	- ti.A op tj.B: This compares two attributes of the tuples
		- op is the set of comparison operators
	- ti.A op c
		- Where c is a constant

#### 3 Universal and Existential Quantifiers
- Example: List the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ department.
	- {t.Fname, t.Lname, t.Address | EMPLOYEE(t) AND (∃d)(DEPARTMENT(d) AND d.Dname=‘Research’ AND d.Dnumber=t.Dno)}
- Safe query
	- Query returns finite tuples as result
