#### 1 Normal forms
- Framework for analyzing relational schema

##### 1 NF
- Disallow multi-valued attributes in a relation
- **How to convert a relation to 1 NF?**
	- Split the relation into two such that one relation has a foreign key that points to the primary key of the other relation

##### 2 NF
- 2 NF Based on Full functional dependency
- **What is full functional dependency?**
	- Consider the functional dependency X -> Y
	- Y is fully functional dependent on X if
		- When any attribute from X is removed, the X can no longer functionally determine Y
		- Example for full functional dependency: {emp_ssn, p_no} -> {hours_worked}
		- Example for partial functional dependency: {emp_ssn, d_no} -> {emp_name} 
			- d_no is not required to determine the emp_name
- **What relations are in 2 NF?**
	- A relation R is in 2 NF if 
		- All the non prime attributes of R are fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R and 
		- R is in 1 NF 
- **How to convert a relation to 2 NF?**
	- Remove the attribs from R that are not fully functionally dependent and create a new relation

##### 3 NF
- Based on transitive dependency
- **What is transitive dependency?**
	- Let a relation R have three sets of attributes X, Y and Z
	- The relation has the following functional dependencies
		- X -> Z is a transitive dependency. This exists if the following two dependencies exists
			- X -> Y
				- X has the prime attributes and functionally determines Y
			- Y -> Z
				- Y is not a prime attribute
				- Y is a set of attributes that is not a subset of the primary key 
- **What relations are in 3 NF?**
	- A relation R is in 3 NF if
		- R is in 2 NF and 
		- There is no transitive dependency in R
- **How to convert a relation to 3 NF?**
	- Remove the functional dependency that has the LHS as non prime attributes
		- In the above example remove Y->Z and create a new relation for this dependency
