#### 1 Normal forms
- Framework for analyzing relational schema
- Help in avoiding update anomalies 
- [Youtube video reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8)

##### 1 NF
- Allow only atomic attributes
	- Disallow set of values and composite attribs 
	- Example: 
		- Customer Relation
		- Attribute Phone number can have a set of values
- **How to convert a relation to 1 NF?**
	- Split the relation into two such that one relation has a foreign key that points to the primary key of the other relation

##### 2 NF
- 2 NF Based on Full functional dependency
- **What is full functional dependency?**
	- Consider the functional dependency X -> Y
	- Y is fully functional dependent on X if
		- When any attribute from X is removed, then X can no longer functionally determine Y
		- Example for full functional dependency: {emp_ssn, p_no} -> {hours_worked}
		- Example for partial functional dependency: {emp_ssn, d_no} -> {emp_name} 
			- d_no is not required to determine the emp_name
	- Let functional dependency X->Y, W -> Z exist in a relation R
		- Here X is the primary key
		- If W is not a subset of X
			- the dependency W -> Z is allowed in the second normal from
		- If W is a subset of X(primary key), then W -> Z is a partial dependency and is not allowed in the second normal form
- **What relations are in 2 NF?**
	- A relation R is in 2 NF if 
		- All the non prime attributes of R are fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R and 
		- R is in 1 NF 
- **How to convert a relation to 2 NF?**
	- Remove the attribs from R that are not fully functionally dependent and create a new relation

##### 3 NF
- Based on transitive dependency
- **What is transitive dependency?**
	- Let a relation R have three **sets of attributes** X, Y and Z
	- The relation has the following functional dependencies
		- X -> Z is a transitive dependency. This exists if the following two dependencies exists
			- X -> Y
				- X is a prime attribute
			- Y -> Z
				- Y is not a prime attribute
				- Y is not a subset of the primary key
					- This the 2 NF condition 
					- If Y is a subset of X, then the relation is not in 2 NF
- **What relations are in 3 NF?**
	- A relation R is in 3 NF if
		- R is in 2 NF and 
		- There is no transitive dependency X -> Z, where
			-  X -> Y dependency is present
			- X is prime attribute and Y, Z is non prime attribute
		- **The transitive dependency X -> Z is allowed, if Z is a subset prime attribute** 
- **How to convert a relation to 3 NF?**
	- Remove the functional dependency that has the LHS as non prime attributes
		- In the above example remove Y->Z and create a new relation for this dependency

#### Boyce-Codd NF
- Disallow transitive dependencies
- **What relations are in BCNF?**
	- A relation R is in BCNF if
		- R is in 3NF and 
		- There is no transitive dependency in R
			- If X is primary key and Z is subset of X, then 
				- **Y -> Z is not allowed**(where Y is a non prime attrib and X -> Y) 
- **Difference between 3 NF and BCNF**
	- 3 NF allows the transitive dependency X -> Z, if Z is a subset of prime attribute
	- BCNF does not allow any transitive dependencies


#### 4 NF
- Based on multi valued dependencies
- **What are multi valued dependencies?**
	- Another form of dependency like functional dependency
	- Lets say there are two attributes a1 and a2
		- For each value of a1 only a set of a2 attributes are allowed
		- This is represented by a1- >> a2
- **What relations are in 4NF?**
	- Relations that are in 3 NF and
	- The relation should have a multi value dependency only on the primary key

#### 5 NF
- Based on join dependencies
