##### 1 Relational data model
- Represents data as a collection of relations
	- Relation is represented as follows
		- R(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub> .... A<sub>N</sub>)
		- Here R is the name of the relation (example Student, Employee)
		- A<sub>i</sub> is an attribute
		- The degree or Arity = N (number of attributes)
		- The relation R will contain set of tuples t 
			- Each tuple will have N values t(u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, ... u<sub>N</sub>)
			- **Each tuple in the relation must be unique**
				- Mathematically set should not contain duplicates
- Each tuple in a relation is a fact
	- A relation is a collection of facts about an entity or relationship
	- Example
		- STUDENT(name, age, id) represents facts about entity student
		- MAJOR(id, Course) represents facts about the relationship beteen ENtity student and Entity Course
- Domain of Attribute
	- Representation
		- Domain of attribute A<sub>i</sub> is dom(A<sub>i</sub>)
	- Significance
		- The possible values of Attribute A<sub>i</sub>
- Mathematical definition of relation
	- R = dom(A<sub>1</sub>) X dom(A<sub>2</sub>) ... dom(A<sub>N</sub>)
	- X is the cartesian product, represents all combinations of values of A<sub>i</sub>
- Cardinality
	- Number of values in a domain
	- Representation
		- |dom(A)|

##### 2 Constraints in relational model
- Key constraints
	- No two tuples should have the same value for the Super key
	- **What is Super Key**?
		- SK is the super key which uniquely identifies the tuple
		- It can be a set of attribs/attrib that are unique to each tuple
- **What is a candidate key**
	- Candidate key can be used as PK (Primary key)
	- Minimal super key is a candidate key
		- Example
		- Relation Student(Name, CollegeID, AadharID)
		- The super keys are 
			- All the combination of attributes with CollegeID
		- Here CollegeID and aadharID are candidate keys
		- One of the candidate keys are assigned as the primary key

##### 3 Relational database schema
- Consists of 
	- Set of N relations
	- Set of Integrity constraints
- Integrity constraints
	- Entity integrity constrains: Primary key != NULL
	- Relational integrity constraints: Tuple should references another existing tuple
- Relational integrity constraint formal def
	- Consider two relations R1, R2
	- A subset of attributes FK (foreign key) for relation R1, references R2 if
		- dom(FK) = dom(PK<sub>R2</sub>)
		- There exists a tuple(t1) in R1 such that t1(FK) = t2(PK), where t2 is a tuple in R2
		- Here the Relations R1 and R2 can be same
