#### 1 Indexing
- #TODO 
- ~~Used to index files~~
- ~~For example~~ 
	- ~~To find a records with a particular value, the DB engine needs to know in which physical block the file containing the record is stored~~
	- ~~The naive approach is to load each block one by one to search for the record, this is slow~~
	- ~~The other approach is to maintain the files in an index, the index will associate a search key with the record and corresponding physical address~~  
		- ~~The records in the file can be organised based on hash or sort key~~
