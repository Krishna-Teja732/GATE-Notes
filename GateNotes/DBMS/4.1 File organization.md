#### 1 Physical organization of the database
- **How is the data stored in the physical medium?**
	- Stored as files of records
	- The data can be accessed differently based on how it is stored
- **What are Files?**
	- Sequence of records
	- File also contains headers
		- Record format
		- Separator info
		- Unspanned or spanned organization
	- Typically the records of a file have the same record format
- **What are records?** 
	- Collection of values, represented as bytes, that describes an entity and its attribs
	- Each value of field describes an entity's attrib
	- Record format/ Record Type
		- Field name and the data type
- **Types of records**
	- Fixed length: records of the same file have the same length 
	- Variable length: records of the same file have different length
- **How to get fields from a stream of bytes?**
	- Each field and value has a separator
	- Each field and value pair will have another separator
	- A record end will have a special separator
	- This is not necessary for fixed length records because the size is already known

#### 2 Storing the File on a block
- **What is a Block?**
	- Block is the unit of transfer for the storage medium
- Files are stored in a block
	- The number of records per block is called the blocking factor
	- Blocking factor = floor(block size/record size)
- If block size is not an integral multiple of record size
	- Unused space is present in the block
		- Unspanned organization: Unused space is not utilized
		- Spanned organization: Unused space is utilized for storing a part of the record. A record can be in two different block in this organization

#### 3 Operations on file
- **What are the type of operations?**
	- Retrieval operations: The data is just fetched
	- Update operations: The data is modified
- **Operations on a file**
	- Open
		- Allocate buffer to hold block from the disk
		- Read the file header 
		- Set the file pointer to the beginning of the file
	- Reset:
		- Set the file pointer to the start of the file
	- Find: 
		- Searches for the record the satisfies the search condition
		- When record is found, move the block containing the record to the buffer
		- Set the file pointer to the record that matches the search condition
	- Read:
		- Copy current record to a program variable
	- Delete:
		- Delete the current record
		- Update the file block to reflect the changes
			- File block need not be updated immediately after deleting the record
	- Insert/Modify
		- Add or modify record, update file block eventually to reflect the changes
	- Close:
		- Completes the file access by releasing the buffers
- **What is the buffer?**
	- Buffer is the portion of main memory allocated for the file operation

#### 4 Organising records in a file VS access methods
- **What is the difference between file organization and access methods?**
	- File Organization
		- Organize data in a file into records, blocks and access data structures 
	- Access methods
		- Operations that can be applied on a file
		- Multiple access methods can be applied on a file
		- Example of an accessing method: access based on indexing
- **What is the goal of the file organization method?**
	- File organization method should make it easier to access the records based on the application
	- Example: Records are searched based on field1, then the records on the physical block can be organised based on field1.
		- This organization might not be suitable for access the records based on another field

#### 5 What are the various types of file organizations?
##### 5.1 Heap
- **How are the records stored?**
	- Unordered records
	- Store the records as they are inserted
- **Advantages:**
	- Insert is fast
	- Copy the last disk block to buffer
	- Add record to the end
	- Write back the disk block
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Searching is linear
	- All blocks need to be searched linearly for finding all matching records
	- Deleting will required reordering the records in the blocks
##### 5.2 Ordered records
- **How are the records stored?**
	- The records are stored in the disk blocks based on the order of a field called the ordering field
- **Advantages**
	- Searching based on the ordering field is faster with binary search
		- Binary search is done on the blocks of data
	- Finding the next record based on the ordering field is simple
- **Disadvantages**
	- Search based on non ordering field requires linear search
	- Ordering does not facilitate random access of records based on field value
	- Inserting and deleting is expensive (need to shift records)
	- Modifying the ordering field of a record is expensive
##### 5.3 Hashing
- Stored based on the hash field
- Constant time access of equality conditions on hash field
- Searching
	- Internal: search content that is loaded in main memory
	- external: search content that is stored in the secondary memory
- **Internal Hashing**
	- Use an array of records
	- Hash key: field value 
	- Hash value: array index
- **External Hashing**
	- Hash key: field value
	- Hash value: Bucket number
	- **What is a bucket?**
		- One or more contiguous disk blocks that can store multiple records
		- Each bucket is numbered uniquely(relatively addressing)
	- **How to get the physical address of bucket using the bucket number?** 
		- A mapping is stored in the file header where the bucket number is mapped to its corresponding physical address
	- **How many buckets are present?**
		- Static hashing: constant
		- Dynamic Hashing or Extensible hashing: variable
- **Extensible hashing**
	- Directory: Array containing of size 2<sup>d</sup> -> 2<sup>d</sup> bucket addresses 
	- Hash key: first d binary bits of the field value
	- Hash value: index in directory, the contents of the directory is the physical address  
	- Each bucket has a size of d'
	- if d' = d and collision occurs, increase the size of array by d+1 -> doubling the array 
	- Basic concept
		- When you have two records with different first bit, one bit is enough to distinguish between them
		- When there is a third record, the second bit of the records is also required assuming that all three records have three different starting bits 
- **Dynamic Hashing**
	- Similar to extensible hashing but has a tree structured directory
