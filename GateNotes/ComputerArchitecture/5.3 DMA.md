##### Use
- Transfer blocks of data btw main and secondary memory with minimal processor intervention

#### Problem
- When processor reads/writes a byte of data
	- the operation occurs only when the processor gets an interrupt or when the processor polls the IO device to check if it is ready
	- This takes more time to access a byte since there are a lot of programs, each would requires its own memory access
- Instead of transferring one byte, a block of data is transferred between main and secondary memory 
	- DMA is a special control unit for block data transfer
- What controls the DMA 
	- The processor sends the starting location, number of words and read/write operation to DMA
	- DMA performs the transfer and keeps track of the memory location while transfer
- How does the DMA transfer the data to the main memory
	- Three modes of transfer
		- Burst mode
			- The buses are allotted to the DMA by the CPU when a block of data is read
		- Cycle stealing mode
			- DMA hands the buses to CPU after transfer of each byte
