##### 1 How does CPU access memory?
- Use a N-bit address
	- Using the N bit address, 2^N memory locations can be accessed
- The processor has control lines to specify read or write of word/byte


##### 2 Metrics for memory operations
- Memory access time
	- Time required for a read or write operation to complete
- Memory Cycle time
	- Minimum interval required between two operations

##### 3 Cache & Virtual memory
- Memory access time (between processor and RAM) is a bottle neck for processor
	- Reduce this by using a faster and smaller memory called cache
- Virtual memory
	- Only the active segment of a program is stored in main memory
	- The rest of the program is stored in secondary memory, when the inactive segment is required for execution, it is swapped
	- The swapping is transparent to the programs


#TODO 
#### 4 Memory devices

#### 5 Read only memory

##### 6 Memory Hierarchy
- The following are the memory devices ordered by the fastest to slowest
	- Processor register
	- L1 cache 
	- L2 Cache
	- RAM
