#### Purpose of this note
- Introduction to machine code
- How machine code is executed
- Various addressing modes to access the operands in the machine code

#### Basic Instructions

```
LOAD R1, LOC
```

- **What?**
	- Loads the contents of the memory in location LOC to register R1
- **How?** (General overview)
	- Control unit sends signals to
		1. fetches instruction from memory
		2. determines the operation
		3. In this case it is a load operation
			- Control unit sends signals to load the word from LOC and store it in Register R1

#### How instructions and operands are stored in memory?
- Memory consists of cells 
	- **What is a cell?**
		- Each cell can store a bit
	- **What is a word?**
		- A collection of N (word length) cells forms a word
	- **How is the memory accessed?**
		- Operation and operands is stored and retrieved in bytes
		- Each byte should have a unique address from \[0 , 2^(k)) where k is the number of bytes in memory
		- If word length is 32
			- first word will be in address 0 and 1
			- second word will be in location 2 and 3 etc
	- **Which is the MSB in the word?**
		- The MSB is determined based on two methods
		- **Big Endian**
			- Lower address will be the MSB
			- Example: 
				- Lets say there is a word(word length 16) in the location 0, 1
				- Byte in location 0 - MSB
				- Byte in location 1 - LSB
		- **Little Endian**
			- Higher Address will be the MSB
			- Example: 
				- Lets say there is a word(word length 16) in the location 0, 1
				- Byte in location 1 - MSB
				- Byte in location 0 - LSB
	- **Word Alignment?**
		- Lets say the word length is N, which consists of N/8 bytes (T: number of bytes in a word)
			- **Aligned word**
				- When the word starts from address that is a multiple of T
				- Example word is stored in location 0, 1 (16 bit word length)
			- **Unaligned word**
				- When the word stars from location that is not a multiple of T
				- Example word is stored in location 1, 2 (16 bit word length)

#### Memory operations
- **Read**
	- The Processor sends a read signal to memory along with the address 
- **Write**
	- The processor sends a write signal to memory along with the address and the contents to write

#### Instructions
- Specifies the operation and the operands
- Should be able to specify the following operations using an instruction
	- Data transfer between processor and memory
	- Arithmetic operations
	- IO transfer
	- Control flow 
- **Notations used**
	- Register transfer notation
		- Eg1: Move contents from memory at location LOC to Register R2
			-  ``R2 <- [LOC]``
		-  Eg2: Add contents in R2 and R3 and store it in R1 
			-  ``R1 <- [R2] + [R3]``
		- Here the square brackets "\[]" are used to specify the contents
			- ``R2 <- LOC``  - will store the immediate value LOC in R2
	- Assembly language notation
		- ``LOAD R2, LOC`` 
		- ``ADD R1, R2, R3``
- **Types**
	- Zero address instructions
		- When using a stack, we use zero address instruction
	- One address instruction
		- When using an Accumulator, one address instruction is used
		- Example: Perform X = A+B
			- Load A      ; loads the value of Mem location A to Accumulator(AC)
			- Add B       ; AC = AC + \[B]
			- Store X     ; store the value in AC to mem location X
	- Two address instruction
		- One of the source registers will be the destination register
		- Example
			- Add R1, R2            ; R1  <-  \[R1] + \[R2]
	- Three address instruction
		- Two sources registers and one destination registers
		- Example
			- Add R3, R1, R2     ; R3  <-  \[R1] + \[R2]
### Instruction Set
