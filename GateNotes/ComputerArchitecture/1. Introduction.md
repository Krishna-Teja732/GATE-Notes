#### What are the functional units of a computer
- I/O units
- Memory
- Processor
	- Control Unit
		-  **Purpose**
			- Coordinates between all function units
			- Executes the instruction program to determine what has to be done
			- Instruction program has the operation and the operands
	- ALU
		- **Purpose**
			- Performs arithmetic operations on the data
		- **How it gets the data and instruction**
			- Control unit is responsible for specifying the operation and operands
	- Registers
		- Instruction Register (IR) - current instruction
		- Program Counter (PC) - address of next instruction to be fetched
		- Memory address register - address of the memory location to read or write
		- Memory data register - data the is read from memory location or data that needs to be written to the memory location is stored in this register
		- General purpose registers

#### Components of a digital computer
- A digital computer consists of the hardware and the software
	- The hardware components include
		- CPU
		- I/O devices
		- Memory

#### Components of the CPU
- The CPU consists of the
	- Arithmetic and Logical Unit(ALU) 
		- Can manipulate data
		- Contains registers for storing data
		- Circuits to fetch and execute instructions
	- Control Unit
		- Coordinates between the hardware components
		- Executes instructions and determines what operation needs to be performed
	- Memory
		- Main memory
		- Cache 
		- Registers
