#### How does the processor access IO devices
- Processor can access memory location using address
- Similarly, a portion of the main memory is allotted for IO. This is called **memory mapped IO**
- The processor can access these reserved memory location and perform read or write operations

#### IO process involved
- The IO devices are slow compared to processor
- The IO interface syncs data transfer
- The Processor receives interrupt signals when IO devices are ready
	- The processor continues to execute other instructions instead of waiting for the IO device
- When an interrupt occurs, the processor
	- Sends an interrupt ack signal to the IO device
	- Executes an interrupt service routine for the interrupt signal
	- The interrupts can be disabled in the IO device using a bit in the IO's status registers
	- The processor can also ignore an interrupt based on the IE bit in the IO's status register
- **How to find the address of the interrupt service routine?**
	- The interrupt signal is sent with a special code
	- This code is used by the processor to determine the interrupt service routine
	- The address of the interrupt service routine is saved in a reserved part of the memory, this is called the IVT
		- **Where is the interrupt service routine stored**?
			- It can be present any where in the memory
- **How to handle multiple interrupts?**
	- Interrupts are prioritized
	- Interrupt with high priority will be acknowledged by the processor, the low priority interrupts are ignored
