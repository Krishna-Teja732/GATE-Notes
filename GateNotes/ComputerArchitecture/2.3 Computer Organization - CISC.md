## **CISC**
- Instruction need not have a fixed size can be multiple words
- Aims to make software simpler as the hardware is capable of implementing complex instructions

#### Instructions
- Uses two address format instead of three address format that is used in RISC
- Example add operation
	- Register transfer notation
		- R1 <- \[R1] + \[R2]
	- Assembly lang notation
		- ADD R1, R2
			- result \[R1] + \[R2] is stored in R1

**Additional addressing modes** #TODO
